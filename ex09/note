Three aspects of seq_file
	* An iterator interface which lets a virtual file implementation
       step through the objects it is presenting.

     * Some utility functions for formatting objects for output without
       needing to worry about things like output buffers.

     * A set of canned file_operations which implement most operations on
       the virtual file.
